3D Trigonometry Experiments

These are a few sketches I built to refresh my long-dormant trig skills.

	randomBlocks
	Randomly-sized blocks rotated around a central circle.

	stringOfBlocks
	Randomly-sized blocks rotated around a central axis.

	mathematicalBlocks
	A few different ways of rotating random and non-random
	blocks around a circle.

See the 'interaction' tab for the controls used to manipulate the view.

Palettes are derived from a random image in the /data/ folder. See http://exnihilo.mezzoblue.com/2009/09/generated-palettes-from-photos/ for full details. Hit the spacebar to regenerate a palette while the sketch is running.
