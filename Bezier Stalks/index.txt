Bezier Stalks

While experimenting with the Processing bezier function, I put together a few sketches like these that manipulate multiple bezier curves in different ways.

	StalkGrid
	A few hundred curves on a grid that gently sway, each 
	according to an individual Perlin noise generated path.

	Blossom
	Similar to StalkGrid; hundreds of swaying curves, but
	arranged in a sort of 3D blossom shape instead.

	RandomTangles
	Setting loose a virtual worm that traces a path through
	3D space, then storing that path for later manipulation

See the 'interaction' tab for the controls used to manipulate the view.

Palettes are derived from a random image in the /data/ folder. See http://exnihilo.mezzoblue.com/2009/09/generated-palettes-from-photos/ for full details. Hit the spacebar to regenerate a palette while the sketch is running.
