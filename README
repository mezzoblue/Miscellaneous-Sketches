This is a collection of experimental sketches I've built while learning the open 
source Processing graphics language (http://processing.org/). 

Perhaps you'll find something useful or interesting. A lot of the code could be cleaned up and improved in a lot of ways, don't go looking for stellar coding practices in here.
