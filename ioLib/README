------------------------------


A starting-point library that formalizes some of the common input / output functions I seem to rebuild and tweak every time I create a new sketch.

Rather than re-invent the wheel every time, I've built this framework with reusability in mind. It doesn't do much on its own, but it adds some fairly useful functions to new sketches.


------------------------------


Basic functions so far:

BITMAP AND VECTOR OUTPUT

	* pressing 's' saves a screencap as PNG
	* pressing 'p' saves a screencap as PDF
		- 3D mode is a bit quirky; the raw triangles are saved, even 
		  for 2D shapes. The background colour doesn't save either.

2D / 3D TOGGLE

	So far everything works with both 2D and 3D renderers, switching is
	a simple matter of adjusting the sceneDimensions variable in the
	user-configurable settings.

PALETTE GENERATION FROM RANDOM IMAGES

	Any images (PNG, JPG or GIF) dropped into data/paletteSource will be 
	used as input for the random palette generation function. The
	paletteCount variable in the user-configurable settings controls
	how large the palette will be.


MOUSE AND KEYBOARD INTERACTION
  
	* click and drag the mouse to rotate in 2D / 3D space
  
	* pressing '+' zooms in, '-' zooms out
	* arrow keys move the scene around
		- holding Shift increases the offset 10x
		- holding Ctrl increases the offset 100x
		- holding Ctrl + Shift increases the offset 1000x

	* pressing 'c' saves the palette
	* pressing 'r' resets the palette
